======

This is zPVHUD's source repository.

zPVHUD is a [PVHUD](http://dl.dropbox.com/u/1565165/pvhud.html) updater, leveraging bash, wget, unzip and Zenity.

The thing supports installing, updating and removing the HUD.
To start using the thing, pop it into your tf/ folder, make it executable, and run it.
It's compatible with the Windows version of the updater, so it'll detect your current installed version if you previously used a wined version.
